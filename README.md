## Deadlines

### Week 5, Wednesday (30 March 2022, 11:59 pm)
A) A **conceptual design of your solution** and **implementation plan** as a group taking into account specifics of the implementation platform (DE2 with or without VGA monitor, or simulated solution).
- Please submit your conceptual designs to Canvas via dedicated link.
- Only one submission per group is required.

### Week 7, Monday (11th April 2022, 11:00 am)
B) A **description and discussion of your project** and the **resulting solution in a joint documentation file**. That should include **final design diagram**, which may be based on your conceptual design delivered in Week 5.

C) Assignment **source code** submitted in electronic form via Canvas.

> This code will be tested by the assessors by executing your submission on a DE2-115 board, so **clear instruction** how to set up the system and execute code has to be provided in a readme.txt file.

Delivery method for the joint documentation and implementation will be via Canvas. If any error
occurs on the submission day and time, submit a zipped file with the file name that contains your group to
the lecturer (Prof Salcic).

D) Confidential peer review.
- Submit the confidential peer review to Canvas. The review must include a textual description of your reflection on the work of your partner with at **least 10 lines**.
- Non-submission of the peer review results in a penalty of 10% of the total mark for the assignment.
